# Second homework for the OOP 2020/2021 course

### How to run

1. Compile all the .cpp files and get the .exe file
2. If you want to load data beforehand, start the .exe file with the following command:
* Homework2.exe "C:\path\to\file.txt" <br>
**[please note that the input on some terminals like "Git Bash" escapes the backslash before reaching the file]** <br>
Otherwise, just start the .exe file without any arguments
3. After that use some of these commands, or look them up by typing "?" or "help"

	PERSON <name> <id> - adds person to the list <br>
	VEHICLE <registration> <description> - adds vehicle to the list <br>
	ACQUIRE <owner-id> <vehicle-id> - person acquires vehicle <br>
	RELEASE <owner-id> <vehicle-id> - person releases vehicle <br>
	SHOW [PEOPLE|VEHICLES|<id>] - shows information about people|vehicles or specific object <br>
	REMOVE <what> - removes person|vehicle from the list <br>
	SAVE <path> - saves data to a file <br>
	cls - clear console <br>
	exit - exit program <br>
