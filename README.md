# Second homework for the OOP 2020/2021 course

### How to run

1. Compile all the .cpp files and get the .exe file
2. If you want to load data, start the .exe file with the following command:
* Homework2.exe "C:\path\to\file.txt" 
**[please note that the input on some terminals like "Git Bash" escapes the backslash before reaching the file]**
3. Otherwise, just start the .exe file without any arguments
4. After that use some of these commands, or look them up by typing "?" or "help"

	PERSON <name> <id> - adds person to the list
	VEHICLE <registration> <description> - adds vehicle to the list

	SHOW [PEOPLE|VEHICLES|<id>] - shows information about people|vehicles or specific object
	REMOVE <what> - removes person|vehicle from the list
	SAVE <path> - saves data to a file
